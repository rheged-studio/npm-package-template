## Changed

- Re-vendored the Rheged ship set and Matt Pocock engineering/productivity packs via the estate catalogue (implement-spec, retro, Rheged `pr`; removed upstream `resolving-merge-conflicts`).
- Renamed domain-modeling `CONTEXT-FORMAT.md` to `GLOSSARY-FORMAT.md` per mattpocock/skills 1.3.0.
- Set `triage-pr` to unattended Phase B (`humanEnvelope: false`) with `followUpLabel: follow-up`; left repo-local `initialise-package-repo` untouched.
